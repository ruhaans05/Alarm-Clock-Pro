# Alarm-Clock-Pro

Alarm Clock Pro is a Java, JavaScript, and HTML based web app that allows you to smartly manage your alarm clock schedules using an AI assistant or manually.

Not only can you set alarms. You can schedule how often they recur, when to stop recurring, and set a DnD period.


I made this to get more familiar with making production-grade code with CI/CD (github actions) and corporate-style file structures.
